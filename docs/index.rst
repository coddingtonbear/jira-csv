Welcome to Jira-Select's documentation!
=======================================

Jira-select is a command-line tool and library that helps you access
the data you want out of Jira.

If you've ever found yourself held back by the limitations of Jira's
built-in query language (a.k.a. JQL), this might be the library for you.
Using Jira-select you can perform a wide variety of SQL-like query
operations including grouping, aggregation, custom functions, and more.
